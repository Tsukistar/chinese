你曾经有过坐下来一一列举过你的习惯的时候吗？习惯造就了我们。好的习惯帮助你变成你想要的样子，而不好的习惯会慢慢地将你变成你最不想成为的样子。

在做了12年多的软件开发者之后，我养成了一些令我引以为傲的习惯，也养成了一些我宁愿改掉的习惯。大多数时候，我并没有意识到我的习惯，但回顾过去，我很清楚哪些习惯帮助我成长，哪些习惯阻碍了我。这促使我盘点并写下一些开发者的好习惯，希望能激励你也这么做。

如果你是以一名开发者的身份开始你的职业生涯，看看下面列出的习惯，问问自己这些习惯是否能帮助你成为你想成为的人。意识到你的习惯并积极培养它们，然后成为一名伟大的软件开发者。

# 自发做一些以前没有做过的事情

在你职业生涯的开始，你知道的事情不多。当你加入一个新项目时，你会觉得自己像是一个“冒牌开发人员”，因为即使你连他们在每场会议上抛出的缩略词、技术和框架的一半都不理解，他们也在向你支付报酬。而另一半你只知道一点点，因为你在谷歌上搜索过。

把“在你职业生涯的开始”换成“在任何新项目的开始”，你就对软件开发职业生涯有了一个很好的总结。

每个新项目，我们都需要重新开始。每一次都有新的人要认识，新的需求要理解，新的框架要学习。这就是为什么学习新东西是很重要的事，如果你只是继续做你知道的事情，你永远不会有信心开始一个新项目，对未知的恐惧总是存在的。

**如果你养成了自愿做你一无所知的任务的习惯，你就会不断地学到新东西。**

如果一个构建需要修复，而你从未使用过对应的构建系统，那就开始吧！你将学习到构建管理相关的知识。

如果JavaScript前端中有一个bug，而你到目前为止只做过Java后端相关的工作，那就修复它吧！你将学习新的Javascript的语言特性。

做一些你没有信心的事情是一个很好的成长方式。不过，一定要管理好别人对你的期望。不要假装你是处理这类事情的高手，告诉他们你以前没有做过，但你想学习。

# Ask to Pair Up

If you're stuck and can't get started with a task because you're unfamiliar with the context, ask someone with experience in the topic to pair up with you.

**A pairing session is a great way to kick off the work on a task.**  Discuss the requirements with your partner until you have an understanding of what is expected. Then, discuss the solution.

What's the context? Which codebase(s) do you have to touch? What are the explicit and implicit conventions in the codebase?

But you can take pairing even further.  **Instead of just pairing up to kick off a task, schedule more time with your partner**. After kicking off the topic, start working on it together. You drive, your partner gives advice, then the other way around.

This way, you even get to learn how your partner thinks and solves problems. You can only profit from it! Even if it's just a new IDE shortcut you learned.

**A note on working from home:** due to working from home, I struggled with things that would not have been a problem before. I hesitated to ask teammates to pair up with me. What was a simple tap on a teammate's shoulder in the office became a high barrier when working remotely and communicating with video conferencing software.

If that is a problem in your team, talk about it with your teammates (in a retro, for example) and it will be much easier afterward. Turns out it's just a habit to re-learn.

# Talk about What You're Doing (and What You're Not Doing)

I don't remember how often I have eagerly taken on a task, thinking I'd be done within a day, but I end up still working on it a week later.

It gets better with experience, but I still find myself making too optimistic estimations. There are just too many reasons to make an optimistic estimation:

-   the pressure to deliver this new feature quickly because the deadline is looming,
-   the pressure to look good among peers,
-   things just not working as I expect them to (this is the one that's most commonly throwing me off, even with years of experience),
-   and a lot more ...

Chances are that most of your estimations end up being too optimistic. What can you do about that?

**You can manage expectations along the way.**

Continuously talk about what you're doing and what is holding you up. With "continuously" I don't mean that you should provide a status update to the whole team every 15 minutes. But make sure the relevant people know where you stand at the start or the end of the day, at least.

So, if your manager / team / project manager / product manager / stakeholder expects results from you, give them a quick update every day: "This is what I've been doing. This is the next step. This is a problem I'm facing. These are the options."

This will let everyone know of your progress. No one will blame you if you're hitting a wall, as long as you kept them in the loop.

This will make discussions of the type "Why did that take so long?" a thing of the past. As an added benefit, the status update will trigger discussions that can help solve problems.

In the best case, this status update is ritualized in the team. It's commonly called "daily standup" where every team member quickly updates the rest of the team about their progress and problems.

But even if you have a daily ritual like that, take a couple of minutes to think if anyone should be updated that is not part of the daily ritual. Should they be included? Or should they be updated through some other mechanism?

**Make it a habit to regularly update the people that have an interest in the results of your work.**

# 写博客

对你来说我可能不是第一个这样说的人，但我还是要说:写博客！

它甚至不必是公开的。它可以是公司wiki中的几页，也可以是带有示例代码和几行解释性文本的GitHub存储库的集合。

为什么呢？

**因为“带着教会他人的目的进行写作”是一个很棒的学习和成长的方式。**

写下你是如何解决一个棘手的问题的。写下如何使用你一直想尝试的新框架。或者把你每周做的事情写在博文里(这也有助于养成“谈论你正在做的事情”的习惯，因为你可以查看你一直在做的事情)。

我开过几次博客。一开始很难保持动力，因为没有人会读你的博客文章，在收不到任何反馈的情况下坚持写作会有一种非常奇怪的感觉，所以我停下来了。然后，我在三年前开始了[我现在的博客][1]，在没有读者的情况下写了半年。我才注意到我的“robots.txt”文件不允许搜索引擎索引我的博客！所以我修改了robots.txt文件，人们开始读我写的东西了。虽然不多，但它给了我继续下去的动力。所以，我坚持下来了，在这个过程中我不断调整我的写作技巧，我的博客业发展到每月浏览量超过20万。

这一切都是因为我开始写_我_想学习的框架和_我_已经解决的问题，这样_我_就可以在_我_需要的时候再次查阅我的文章。做这件事的初衷不是因为我想吸引大批观众。

写博客一开始是一件苦差事，但如果你坚持下去，它会变得非常有益。如果你这样做的目的是为了学习和教学，你不仅会学到很多东西，而且其他人最终会注意到你的博客，它将打开一个充满机会的世界。

# Have a Notebook and a System

I've only recently grown to be a big fan of notebooks. Not a computer notebook, but a real, paper notebook. I take it (and a pen!) wherever I go, so I can take notes about whatever strikes me as important at any time.

I take notes when I listen to a talk, or when I'm waiting for the bus, thinking about what I could make for dinner this week.

I also use the notebook to maintain lists: books I want to read, frameworks I want to try out, features I want to add to my side projects. Most importantly, I use it to take notes while reading books, because that conserves the learnings from the book.

I'm writing down everything that weighs on my mind.  **If I don't write it down, it will keep my mind busy**, sometimes to the extent that I'm getting anxious and have trouble sleeping.

The reason I'm getting anxious without my notebook is that I don't trust my memory. If you have a great memory and can recall everything that you have thought about a week ago, you probably don't need a notebook. If your memory is as patchy as mine, though, it will make a world of a difference to your peace of mind.

**To build trust in your notebook, you need a system**. You need to convince your mind that whatever you put into the notebook will not be lost.

Create an index on the first couple of pages of the notebook to make the information retrievable. Then, make it a habit to review your notes regularly and process them.

To process the notes I'm taking while reading a book, for instance, I review the notes whenever I'm done with the book and write a book review on my blog. Almost no one reads these reviews, but the process of writing the review makes the things I learned stick so much better.

# Keep Notes about Your Wins

Having a notebook can also help with the next habit: documenting your achievements.

As I said, my memory is patchy at the best of times. I can usually remember what I had for lunch yesterday, but if I'm deep in focus and spending brain power on some gnarly problem, the halftime of my memory goes down considerably.

That's why I like to document my achievements at the end of the day. It's usually not big achievements, but small wins - like having beaten a bug, or having finished one of the many steps towards adding a new feature to the software I'm working on. I also document personal wins like having stuck to my morning workout routine.

I just create a list of bullet points each evening in my notebook, but it'll also work with a digital medium like a spreadsheet or whatever you're most comfortable with - as long as you stick with it.

Over time, the achievements aggregate. You might want to mark the ones that are most important to you so you can easily find them later.

Then, on an occasion like a  **performance review,** you go through that list,  **find the achievements that are relevant to that occasion, and list them out to prepare.** Performance reviews always work out better when you're prepared.

Having a list of your achievements also helps in every-day situations to talk about what you've been doing (see habit "Talk about what you're doing").

# Have a Time Slot for Important Tasks

At the end of the day, I often feel I haven't accomplished anything. While it helps to document your wins or even just the things you did, you still need to actually do those things.

It happens quickly that you go from meeting to meeting and suddenly the day is over. After a meeting, you want to continue the task you started before the meeting, but just when you've warmed up, the next meeting starts. And after that meeting, you have to start over, because you lost the context.

**Context switching is killing productivity.**

If there's one thing I learned to be productive, it's having a dedicated time slot for things you want to get done. If you don't have a pre-planned time slot for a task, chances are slim that you will get started on it. It will be eaten up by every-day work or other planned work.

There isn't a single way to implement a time management habit, and, to be honest, I'm hopping from one productivity method to the next every couple of months. But the core is always the same: block some time in your day for the things you want to get done most.

I block an hour in the morning, before work, to write articles for  [my blog][2]  (or for other blogs, like this one). Most days, I also block an hour in the evening, when the kids are in bed, to work on any side project I might have.

Currently, I have a Trello board with  [one column for every day of the week][3]  where I put the tasks I want to do in the morning and the evening. Once a week, I update that board with the things I want to do in the next week, so I don't have to waste my precious blocked time with thinking about what to do next.

I have a very similar Trello board for my software developer job. Every morning, I think of the things I want to do and put them into the column for the day.

I also block at least 2 hours of focus time in my calendar every day, so that my co-workers don't try to schedule any meetings at that time. That's when I get through my list of tasks.

It doesn't really matter how you manage your time, **but it's important to do it and to make it a habit**.  Otherwise your days will be eaten up by things that are not important to you.

# When Stuck, Take a Break

As software developers, we tend to get stuck a lot. And boy, does it piss me off when I'm stuck and don't see a way out.

It's such obvious advice to take a break when you're stuck, but it's so hard to do. "I'm so close to solving the problem, I can't take a break now!"

Also, taking a break now would mean I would have to warm up to the topic again later. Why should I deliberately switch contexts when context switching is the number one source of wasted time?

When you're stuck, you're not thinking straight. You're thinking about how stupid it is to be stuck with this problem, how easily your teammates would probably solve it, and why they always get the easy tasks. But you're not thinking about how to solve the problem.

Take a break and work on something else for a time. Or even better, try again the next day. Getting some distance to the problem will allow you to see solutions you were blind to before.

If you haven't tried this before, you won't believe how often a problem is "just solved" the next morning. Mostly because you see a path to a solution that you haven't seen before.

Now, it's easy to say to take a break, but how do you identify that you're currently in "stuck mode" and then persuade yourself to quit working on the problem for a time?

I'm honestly not very good at this myself, because I usually WANT THIS DUMB TASK OUT OF THE WAY so I can show that I've achieved something!

But what I found that helps me is to **divide my day into 30-minute slices and have a quick recap after each of those slices.**  This technique is called the Pomodoro technique based on those tomato-shaped kitchen timers.

After each pomodoro unit, I'm asking myself if I'm still working in a "solution mode", or if I'm stuck and should work on something else for a while.

A nice benefit of the pomodoro technique is that you can use the end of a unit as a trigger for other habits.

I use it as a trigger to stand up from my chair to stretch my muscles and drink some water, for example. This is sometimes called "habit stacking", because you're stacking one habit on top of another, and it's very effective.

If you want to read more on habits, I can warmly recommend the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.

# Don't Chase Silver Bullets

I wrote a  [book][4]  on a specific architectural style and I regularly get emails saying "I love that architecture style and I want to apply it to all of my projects! How can I do that?".

Can you guess my answer to that question?

There is no single architectural style that applies to all problems out there.

You build a plain CRUD API when it's a small project. You build a more sophisticated Hexagonal Architecture if you have a complex domain model. And you apply any of a hundred different styles when you're building microservices in a specific context.

Similarly, there is no single framework you should use for every single project. And there is no single best programming language or coding style.

Don't fall for silver bullets. They don't exist.

**Having an opinion is good if it's backed with good arguments.**  "This is the best architecture style" or "I've always done it like this" are not good arguments and people will see through them.

Just imagine you have a developer on your team that has an opinion on everything and always wants to do things their way, "because it's the best way". You would get tired of that very quickly. Don't be that person.

# 养成这些习惯!

哇，这篇文章比我想象的要长。我希望这篇文章能给你一些启发，让你知道在发展软件开发者的职业生涯时应该考虑些什么。当然，我还没有完全掌握这些习惯，但我每天都在努力做得更好。

选择一个最能让你产生共鸣的习惯，并有意识地把它应用到日常工作中。
